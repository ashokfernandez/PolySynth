# Project PolySynth

Welcome to the **PolySynth** project.
This repository contains the master plan and source code for a professional-grade, cross-platform polyphonic synthesizer.

## 📚 Documentation
The project is driven by a strict set of planning documents. **You must read these before contributing.**

1.  [**Vision & Strategy**](plans/01_vision_and_strategy.md): The high-level goals and "Hybrid" approach.
2.  [**Architecture**](plans/02_architecture.md): The "Hub & Spoke" technical design.
3.  [**Agentic Workflow**](plans/03_agentic_workflow.md): How to use AI personas (@Architect, @DSPEngineer).
4.  [**Testing Strategy**](plans/04_testing_strategy.md): The "Headless" and "Golden Master" testing rules.
5.  [**Program Management**](plans/05_program_management.md): The roadmap and ADR process.

## 🏗 Directory Structure
*   `plans/`: The documentation listed above.
*   `src/core/`: The **Platform Agnostic** DSP Engine (Pure C++).
